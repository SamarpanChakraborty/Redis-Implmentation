Caching your web application is highly essential and can grant high performance gains as you scale. Be it a search engine and you want to respond to frequently requested queries with minimum latency, a URL shortener and you want to redirect to frequently accessed URLs faster, a social network and you want to load popular user profiles quicker, or perhaps a very simple web server that requests data from a third party web API and you have plans to scale, caching data can prove to be very fruitful!
What is Redis? Why use Redis?
Redis is a high performance open source NoSQL database primarily used as a caching solution for various types of applications.

Redis also supports many different data types and clients based on different programming languages. You can find out more about Redis here.
